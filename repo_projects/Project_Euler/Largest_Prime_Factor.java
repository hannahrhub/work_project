// factor that is a prime number. In other words: any of the prime numbers that can be multiplied to give the original number
// Example: The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5 (because 3Ã—5=15, and 3 and 5 are prime
//The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
//What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
